// These commands run as whatever user the server runs as - root in most
// deployments, because configuring the VPN network needs it. Anyone who can
// write the config file therefore decides what the server executes as root,
// which is why they are read from the config file only (never from flags or
// environment variables) and why the file's permissions are checked before a
