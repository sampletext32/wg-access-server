# Storage

wg-access-server supports 4 storage backends.

| Backend  | Persistent | Supports HA | Use Case                                 |
| -------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| memory   | ❌         | ❌          | Local development                        |
| sqlite3  | ✔️         | ❌          | Production - single instance deployments |
| postgres | ✔️         | ✔️          | Production - multi instance deployments  |
| mysql    | ✔️         | ❌          | Production - single instance deployments |

## Backends

### Memory

This is the default backend if you're running the binary directly and haven't configured
another storage backend. Data will be lost between restarts. Handy for development.

### SQLite3

This is the default backend if you're running the docker container directly or using docker-compose.

The database file will be written to `/data/db.sqlite3` within the container by default.

Sqlite3 is probably the simplest storage backend to get started with because it doesn't require
any additional setup to be done. It should work out of the box and should be able to support a
large number of users & devices.

Example connection string:

- Relative path: `sqlite3://path/to/db.sqlite3`
- Absolute path: `sqlite3:///absolute/path/to/db.sqlite3`

!!! note "Upgrading an existing SQLite database"

    v1.3.0 moved to a newer database library, which spells a few column types differently
    (`text` instead of `varchar(255)`, `integer` instead of `bigint`). SQLite treats them
    the same, but it cannot change a column type in place, so the first start after the
    upgrade rebuilds the `devices` table once. The data is carried over, and later starts
    leave the table alone. PostgreSQL and MySQL schemas are unchanged.

### PostgreSQL

This backend requires an external Postgres database to be deployed. Every release is tested against
PostgreSQL 13 and 18, the oldest and the newest version their vendor supports; the versions in
between are expected to work and are checked before releases.

Postgres experimentally supports highly-available deployments of wg-access-server
and is the recommended storage backend where possible.
If you have pgbouncer running in front of PostgreSQL, make sure it is running in "Session pooling" mode,
as the more aggressive modes like "Transaction Pooling" break LISTEN/NOTIFY which we rely on.
They also break the session-level advisory lock that keeps replicas from assigning the same VPN
address to two devices created at the same time.

Example connection string:

- `postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/database?sslmode=disable`

#### What the replicas send each other

The replicas learn about a change through `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY`. Those notifications say that the
devices table changed and nothing more: which device it was, and what is in its row, is not part of
them. Every replica reads the devices from the database instead, as the user it connects as.

This matters because a notification reaches **every connection that listens on the channel**, and
Postgres applies no table privileges to it. A database user who may connect but may not read the
devices would otherwise see every one of them as it is written, with its addresses, its owner's
identity and its pre-shared key. Sharing the database with another application, or having a
read-only user for reports, is enough for that to matter.

What it costs: a change makes each replica read the devices once, rather than apply the row it was
handed. The reads are coalesced - one runs at a time and one more is remembered - so importing many
devices at once does not read them once per device.

### MySQL

This backend requires an external MySQL database to be deployed. Every release is tested against
MySQL 8.0 and 9, and against MariaDB 11.4 - other flavours are expected to work, as wg-access-server
talks to all of them through [this golang driver](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql).

Example connection string:

- `mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/database?tls=false`

!!! warning "Upgrading an older MySQL installation"

    Up to and including v1.2.0 the schema migration failed silently on MySQL, which left the
    database without the unique index on `public_key`. Two devices could then share a public
    key. The WireGuard peer is identified by that key, so the device added last replaces the
    allowed addresses and the pre-shared key of the one added first, and that first device
    stops working. From v1.3.0 on the index is created when the server starts. If the table
    already holds devices sharing a key, the server refuses to start and tells you how to
    find them:

    ```sql
    SELECT public_key, COUNT(*) FROM devices GROUP BY public_key HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
    ```

    Delete all but one device per key - they cannot all work anyway - and start the server again.
    PostgreSQL and SQLite were never affected.

Query parameters are passed to the driver as-is, so they must use its names - e.g. `tls` rather
than `ssl-mode`. The driver runs any parameter it does not know as `SET <name>=<value>` on the
server, which for `ssl-mode` fails with a syntax error. wg-access-server always sets
`parseTime=true`, which it needs to read devices.

### File (removed)

The `file://` backend was deprecated in 0.3.0 and has been removed in 0.4.0

If you'd like to migrate your `file://` storage to a supported backend you must use
version 0.3.0 and then follow the migration guide below to migrate to a different storage backend.

_Note that the migration tool itself doesn't support the `file://` backend on versions
released after 0.3.0_.

## Schema Upgrades

The SQL backends keep track of their schema: every change to it is a migration that runs once per
database, and the ones already applied are listed in the `schema_migrations` table. On start,
wg-access-server applies whatever is missing and logs each one (`Applying database migration ...`).

- **Upgrading from a version without migrations** needs nothing: the existing tables are taken over
  as they are, and the first start records them.
- **Several replicas** sharing a PostgreSQL or MySQL database take turns: one migrates while the
  others wait for it, up to 10 minutes.
- **Downgrading** is refused once a newer version has migrated the database - the start fails,
  naming the migrations this version does not know. The newer schema may not fit what the older
  version writes. Run the newer version again, or restore a backup taken before the upgrade.
- **MySQL** cannot roll back changes to the schema. If a migration fails there, fix the cause and
  start again: a migration that was interrupted completes on the next start.

Take a backup before upgrading, as with any database.

## Migration Between Backends

You can migrate your registered devices, API tokens and users - with the passwords they set for
themselves, their second factors and their passkeys - between backends using the
`wg-access-server migrate <src> <dest>` command. Stop the server first: devices added while the
migration runs are left behind.

The migrate command was added in `v0.3.0` and is provided on a _best effort_ level. As an open source
project any community support here is warmly welcomed.

### Example: `file://` to `sqlite3://`

If you're using the now deprecated `file://` backend you can migrate to `sqlite3://` like this:

```bash
# after upgrading to place1/wg-access-server:v0.3.0
docker exec -it <container-name> wg-access-server migrate file:///data sqlite3:///data/db.sqlite3
```

If you need to do the above within a kubernetes deployment substitute `docker exec` with the equivalent
`kubectl exec` command.

The migrate command is non-destructive but it's always a good idea to take a backup of your data first!

### Example: `sqlite3://` to `postgresql://`

First you'll need to make sure your postgres server is up and that you can connect to it from your
wg-access-server container/pod/vm.

```bash
wg-access-server migrate sqlite3:///data/db.sqlite3 postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/database?sslmode=disable
```

Remember to update your wg-access-server config to connect to postgres 😀
