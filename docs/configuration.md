# Configuration

You can configure wg-access-server using environment variables, cli flags or a config file.

**The config file wins.** It is read last, so any setting it names overrides the same setting given
as a cli flag or an environment variable; among the other two, a cli flag overrides an environment
variable. Setting the same thing in both a file and the environment is the one thing to avoid: the
environment value is then simply ignored, which is how deployments end up with an admin account that
does not exist. The server warns at startup when it happens for the settings where that hurts most.

A setting written under the wrong heading is a related trap - `externalHost` belongs at the top
level, and under `wireguard:` it configures nothing. Keys the configuration has no home for are
ignored rather than refused, so that a file written for another version still starts, but the server
says at startup that it found one.

The default configuration should work out of the box if you're just looking to try it out.

The only required configuration is a wireguard private key.
You can generate a wireguard private key by [following the official docs](https://www.wireguard.com/quickstart/#key-generation).

TLDR:

```bash
wg genkey
```

The config file format is `yaml` and an example is provided [below](#the-config-file-configyaml).
A file that sets the same option twice is refused at start-up, naming both lines - one of the two
values would otherwise quietly win.

The format for specifying multiple values for options that allow it is:

- as commandline flags:
  - repeat the flag (e.g. `--dns-upstream 2001:db8::1 --dns-upstream 192.0.2.1`)
  - separate the values with a comma (e.g. `--dns-upstream 2001:db8::1,192.0.2.1`)
- as environment variables:
  - separate with a comma (e.g. `WG_DNS_UPSTREAM="2001:db8::1,192.0.2.1"`)
  - separate with a new line char (e.g. `WG_DNS_UPSTREAM=$'2001:db8::1\n192.0.2.1'`)
- in the config file as YAML list.

Here's what you can configure:

## Access policies

A policy names the networks the devices of the people in it may reach, instead of `vpn.allowedIPs`:

```yaml
vpn:
  allowedIPs: ["0.0.0.0/0", "::/0"] # everybody who is in no policy
  policies:
    contractors:
      allowedIPs: ["10.0.5.0/24"]
    staff:
      allowedIPs: ["10.0.0.0/8", "192.168.0.0/16"]
```

Who is in which policy is decided by the identity provider - see
[policyMapping](./auth.md#access-policies). Somebody in several policies may reach the networks of
all of them; somebody in none keeps `vpn.allowedIPs`, which is what every device had before policies
existed.

A policy has to name at least one network. To give somebody `vpn.allowedIPs`, leave them out of
every policy rather than writing a policy with nothing in it - the server refuses to start on one,
because an empty list is far more often a mistake in the file than a deliberate "reaches nothing".

The server also refuses to start when a rule names a policy that is not configured here, and warns
about a policy that no rule puts anybody in. A policy name may hold letters, digits and underscores,
at most 32 of them: it becomes part of a firewall set name.

### What the rules look like

Policies need `vpn.firewall: nftables`, and the server refuses to start with any other backend. Each
policy becomes a set of the addresses of its members' devices and a rule per network:

```
set policy_contractors_ip { type ipv4_addr; elements = { 10.44.0.2 } }

ip saddr 10.44.0.0/24 ip daddr 10.44.0.1 accept          # the server itself, for everybody
ip saddr @policy_contractors_ip ip daddr 10.0.5.0/24 accept
ip saddr @policy_members_ip reject                       # a member reaches nothing else
ip saddr 10.44.0.0/24 ip daddr 0.0.0.0/0 accept          # everybody who is in no policy
```

The rule count therefore follows the number of policies, not the number of devices: a thousand
devices change what is in the sets, not how many rules there are. iptables has no such lookup - it
would need a rule per device and network - which is why policies are nftables only.

Two things every member keeps whatever their policy says: the **server's own addresses**, because
that is where the embedded DNS proxy answers, and whatever `vpn.allowedIPs` reaches is *not* among
them - a policy replaces that list rather than adding to it.

**A policy restricts per address family.** On a server with IPv4 and IPv6, a policy that names IPv4
networks only lets its members reach those over IPv4, and over IPv6 nothing but the server - not
what `vpn.allowedIPs` opens over IPv6. To let them out over IPv6 too, name IPv6 networks in the
policy.

The rules are rebuilt when a device is added, changed or removed, and when somebody signs in, since
that is when their policies can change. On Postgres every replica hears about both. A device that
may not connect - blocked, or past its expiry - is in no set: it has no peer, so nothing can come
from its address.

## Firewall

wg-access-server sets up the rules that forward the clients' traffic to the networks in
`vpn.allowedIPs` and reject everything else they send, isolate the clients from each other with
`vpn.clientIsolation`, and masquerade their traffic on the gateway interface (`vpn.nat44`,
`vpn.nat66`). `vpn.firewall` decides how:

- **`iptables`** (default) - chains of its own, `WG_ACCESS_SERVER_FORWARD` and
  `WG_ACCESS_SERVER_POSTROUTING`, for IPv4 and IPv6.
- **`nftables`** - one table of its own, `inet wg_access_server`, for IPv4 and IPv6. It is replaced
  as a whole on every start, in a single transaction, and uses native nftables only. Choose it on
  hosts that manage their firewall with `nft`, or whose kernel lacks the iptables compatibility
  modules: the iptables in the Docker image writes to nftables, too, but needs those modules for
  `REJECT` and `MASQUERADE`. Outside of Docker, it needs the `nft` command.
- **`none`** - wg-access-server does not touch the firewall, for setups that manage it themselves.

Both backends set up the same rules. Switching between `iptables` and `nftables` removes the rules
of the other one, so no old reject keeps applying next to the new rules. `none` leaves any rules of
an earlier start in place.

Accepting a packet only ends the chain it is in. Another firewall on the host - firewalld, ufw,
Docker's own rules - can still drop what wg-access-server accepts, with either backend. If clients
can connect but reach nothing, look there.

## Lifecycle commands

`wireguard.preUp`, `postUp`, `preDown` and `postDown` run shell commands around the lifecycle of the
WireGuard interface, like the options of the same name in a `wg-quick` configuration. The typical use
is a route that wg-access-server does not set up itself:

```yaml
wireguard:
  postUp:
    - "ip route add 192.168.178.0/24 dev %i"
  preDown:
    - "ip route del 192.168.178.0/24 dev %i"
```

- `%i` is replaced with the interface name, which is also passed to the command as `$WG_INTERFACE`.
- The commands of a phase run in order, through `sh -c`. A failing `preUp` or `postUp` command stops
  the server: a network that is only half set up is not what you asked for. A failing `preDown` or
  `postDown` command is logged, the shutdown continues.
- `preUp` runs before the interface is created, `postUp` after the firewall rules are in place,
  `preDown` while the interface still exists and `postDown` once it is gone.
- Nothing runs when the embedded WireGuard server is disabled - there is no interface then.

These commands run as the user the server runs as, which is root in most deployments. They can
therefore **only be set in the config file**, never through a flag or an environment variable, and
wg-access-server refuses to run them - and refuses to start - unless the config file is writable by
its owner alone and owned either by root or by the user running the server.

## The Config File (config.yaml)

Here's an example config file to get started with.

```yaml
loglevel: info
storage: sqlite3:///data/db.sqlite3
wireguard:
  privateKey: "<some-key>"
dns:
  upstream:
    - "2001:678:e68:f000::"
    - "2001:678:ed0:f000::"
    - "5.1.66.255"
    - "185.150.99.255"
```
